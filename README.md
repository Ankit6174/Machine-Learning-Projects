# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Projects** repository. This repository showcases a variety of machine learning models and techniques, covering a range of topics from data preprocessing to model evaluation and deployment. Each project is structured to provide a comprehensive understanding of machine learning workflows.

## About

This repository is a collection of machine learning projects that demonstrate various algorithms and methods applied to real-world datasets. The projects range from beginner to advanced levels and include detailed explanations of the code, data, and results.

### Objectives:
- To explore and implement popular machine learning algorithms.
- To develop and fine-tune models to improve their performance.
- To analyze datasets and derive insights.

## Technologies Used

The following tools and libraries are commonly used in these projects:

- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** 
  - `NumPy`
  - `Pandas`
  - `Scikit-learn`
  - `Matplotlib`
  - `Seaborn`
  - `TensorFlow` / `PyTorch`
- **Tools:** 
  - Jupyter Notebooks
  - Git for version control

## Projects

1. **Rock vs Mine Prediction** - *Brief Description*: `I used Logistic Regression to predict the given object is rock or a mine.`
2. **Heart Data Analysis** - *Brief Description*: `This is not a machine learning project. But for basic understand of core statistics I make this project. This is a simple heart data analysis of patient of a hospital that can analyze some factors based upon data.`
3. **Diabetes Prediction** - *Breif Description*: `In this project, I created a simple diabetes patient regocnizer with the help of a machine learning algorithm and which is Decision Tree Classifier. This model can predict that the patient is suffered from diabetes or not with the help of given features like, Blood Pressure, FBS, Smoking and more.`
4. **Digit Prediction Webapp** - *Brief Description*: `I used Random Forest Classifier to predict the given image.`

Each project is contained in its own folder with a dedicated README explaining the dataset, methods used, and findings.
